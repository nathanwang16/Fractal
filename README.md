# Fractal


Reproduction and exploration of the paper, + the LessWrong posts. 


1. Reproduction of the chaos games
2. Reproduction of a simplex from a 3-state HMM
3. compare and contrast
4. exploration of the residual streams in a simple transformer
5. 


Observations:

1. Transformers does more than an observer. Observer is human and thus have pre-conceived knowledge about what will be predicted. Such as only alphabet will be the output, only 3 possible hidden states. Transformer can purely learn these from data.
