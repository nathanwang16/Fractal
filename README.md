# Fractal

Reproduction and exploration of the paper, + the LessWrong posts.

1. Reproduction of the chaos games
3. Reproduction of a simplex from a 3-state HMM.
4. compare and contrast
5. exploration of the residual streams in a simple transformer
6.

Observations:

1. Transformers does more than an observer. Observer is human and thus have pre-conceived knowledge about what will be predicted. Such as only alphabet will be the output, only 3 possible hidden states. Transformer can purely learn these from data.
2. A simplex is a distribution graph of for a HMM where the barycentric values are the corresponding possibilites.
